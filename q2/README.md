## Create an image gallery like video with Nextjs intercepting and parallel routes.

you first need to learn Nextjs intercepting and parallel routes individually, then use those for create image gallery.

- You should show many image in home page.
- When you click on each image, show a modal(you should create this modal in parallel route and intercepting route)
- Then when you refresh the page, it should show common route(exit from parallel route and intercepting route)

Hint: if you know parallel route and intercepting route, you can do this homework.
